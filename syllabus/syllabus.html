<h1 align=center>Phys 2502<br>
Laboratory in Electromagnetism and Mechanics II
</h1>
<p align=center>
Spring Semester 2015<br>
<u>Professor Richard Jones</u>
<h2>Content and preparation</h2>
<ul>
	<li> PHYS 2502 is a laboratory course devoted to the study of
	mechanical and electromagnetic phenomena, with an emphasis on
        the analysis and interpretation of experimental data, and their
        dissemination in the form of written scientific articles and
        oral presentations.
        </li>
	<li> The course has a significant writing component.  A written
	report describing the methods used and results obtained is required
        for each experiment.  For two of the experiments, students must write
        an 8-page scientific article in which they present a rationale for
        the measurement, a description of the experimental setup and methods
        used, the quantitative results obtained, and their interpretation.
        Special attention must be given to experimental errors, and the
        soundness of conclusions that can be drawn from the measurement.
        </li>
	<li> Students should have already successfully completed Physics
	1201 or 1401 or 1501 or 1601.  The second part of the introductory
        physics sequence covering electricity and magnetism would be helpful
        but is not required.  English 1010 or 1011 or 3800 are also required.
        </li>
	<li> The goals for the course are that students demonstrate their
	ability to 
 	<ol>
		<li><b>collect experimental data</b> using computer-
		controlled scientific apparatus;
                </li>
		<li><b>create an appropriate model</b> of an experimental
                setup and generate predictions based on sound theoretical
                principles;
                </li>
		<li><b>develop skills in numerical data analysis</b> using
                appropriate applications and/or programming frameworks;
                </li>
		<li><b>understand experimental errors</b> and how they
		propagate through the theoretical analysis;
                </li>
		<li><b>draw sound scientific conclusions</b> from
		experimental results.
                </li>
		<li><b>write up experimental results</b> in a form suitable
                for publication in a scientific journal.
                </li>
 	</ol></li>
</ul>

<h2>Course materials</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Text books:</b> Students are encouraged to obtain a copy of
	either one or the other of the following two books on error analysis.
        Taylor is a more introductory text, with helpful examples
        of how data analysis techniques are applied in practical cases.
	Bevington is more advanced and will be useful as a reference for
	students interested in pursuing experimental research beyond this
	course.  Both of these books are available from the UConn Coop,
        as well as from online vendors such as amazon.com.

<h2>Assignments</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>In-class assignments:</b> In-class time is divided between
        one hour-long weekly period with the instructor and one weekly
        laboratory period supervised by a teaching assistant.  In-class
        time will be devoted to three major topics.
        <ol>
		<li>Introduction and theoretical background for the
                experiments
                </li>
                <li>Tutorials and group exercises in data and error
                analysis
                </li>
                <li>Instruction in scientific writing and peer critique
                </li>
        </ol>
        Individual and group assignments will regularly be collected during
        these periods.  Participation in these periods will be an important
        part of your final grade for the course.
        </li>

	<li><b>Regular reports:</b> Each student must submit an individual
        report for each of the laboratory experiments.  In addition to the
	experiments, students will also be given tutorials in advanced data
	analysis that they will work on in groups.  For the tutorials,
        the lab instructor will accept a completed project file from each
        student in place of a written report.  In all other cases, a written
        report is required from each student for each experiment. The reports
        should contain the following elements:
	<ol>
		<li>a descriptive title and the author's name;
                </li>
		<li>an abstract describing the purpose of the experiment
                framed as an hypothesis, the experimental methods used,
                a summary of the results, and a conclusion that addresses
                the hypothesis;
                </li>
		<li>an introduction describing the purpose of the experiment
		and the details of the apparatus, including at least one
                figure, and more where that would be helpful;
                </li>
		<li>an description of the theoretical model of the experiment
                and how the measurements are interpreted;
                </li>
		<li>your data presented in a readily understandable
                form such as tables and graphs, together with errors;
                </li>
		<li>a description of how you took the raw data and analyzed
                them in terms of the theoretical model described earlier,
		with an emphasis on error propagation;
                </li>
		<li>presentation of the final results and comparison with
                prior published results from other experiments, and a
                conclusion that addresses the hypothesis.
                </li>
	</ol>
        All reports must be submitted in electronic form in pdf format using
        the submission tool provided on the huskyct web site for your course
        laboratory section.  The Teaching Assistant (TA) in charge of your
        section will explain the schedule for when these reports are due,
        and will be responsible for the grading of the regular reports.  The
        course instructor will monitor these reports and give feedback to
        the students on their titles and abstracts.
	</li>

	<li><b>Full-length articles:</b> Instead of in-class midterm and final
	exams, students will chose one of their regular reports from the first
        half of the semester, and another from the second half, and expand them
        into full-length scientific articles edited into a form that could be
        submitted to a scientific journal.  These reports will follow a similar
	format to the one described above for the regular reports, but must be
        more detailed and complete.  In particular, the introduction must be
        separated from the description of the experimental setup and expanded
        to include a reference to at least one scientific article, together
        with a description of how it is related to the present work.  Whereas
        regular reports will normally be only 5-6 pages long, the full-length
        articles will normally be 8-10 pages long and consist of 1500-2000
        words plus equations, figures, and tables.
	Midterm and final articles will be submitted first in draft form,
	and then in final form, after feedback has been received from the 
	instructor and changes incorporated into the report.  The drafts
	must be complete articles; <i>mere skeleton articles, or ones
	that are missing significant portions of data or analysis results
	will not be accepted as completed drafts.</i> Full-length articles
	must be submitted in the form of a pdf file through the submission
        tool provided on the huskyct web site.  The pdf file <i>must</i>
        contain as its first page a cover letter from the student, followed
        by an empty page for instructor feedback and evaluation, followed
        by the article.  A template cover letter for draft and final articles
        will be provided by the instructor.  The due dates for the
        various drafts and final article submission will be announced in
        class, and posted on huskyct.
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Final presentations:</b> Each student will prepare an oral
	presentation of approximately 10 minutes duration on the same subject
	as their final article.  These presentations will be made to 
	other members of the class at the time of the regular lab period
	during the last week of classes.  Presentations must be accompanied
	by slides in electronic form that describe the apparatus and data
	collected in graphical form, and describe the methods used to analyze
	the data and the accompanying errors.  The presentation must also
	make reference to related measurements that are published in
	scientific journals.  The presentation must end with conclusions
	that can be drawn from the experimental results.  Because of the
       	group nature of the final presentations, <i>no late
	work</i> will be accepted for the final presentation.

        To pass this course your aggregate score under all of the above
        categories must be above a minimum acceptable level.  The two
        full-length articles that go through a complete revision and
        editing process, considered by themselves apart from the other
        graded components of the course, must also be above a passing
        grade in order to pass this course.
        </li>

	<li><b>Late or missed work:</b> For students who miss a lab during
	the semester, one week is reserved for make-up close to the end of
	the semester.  Labs take place 2:00-5:00 on Wednesdays.  Groups 
	needing extended time to complete a measurement should arrange with
	the TA to gain access to the laboratory outside of these hours.
	Regular reports are normally due at the beginning of the laboratory
	period a week after the lab is performed.  Special deadlines for
	the full-length articles
	will be posted on the huskyct web site.  Work submitted after the
	deadline will suffer a 1% per hour deduction in points, unless
	granted an exception by the instructor and/or TA for exceptional
	circumstances.  If the exceptional circumstances are known in
	advance, the student should contact the TA and/or instructor to
	obtain an adjusted deadline to make sure no points are lost.
	Students who fail to complete any of the labs or submit weekly
	reports will receive a zero for that lab, but the labs with long
	reports that substitute for midterm and final exams are mandatory.
	You cannot pass this course without completing those assignments.
	</li>

        <li><b>Academic Integrity</b>: In this course we aim to conduct
	ourselves as a community of scholars, recognizing that academic study
	is both an intellectual and ethical enterprise. You are encouraged
	to build on the ideas and texts of others; that is a vital part of
	academic life. You are also obligated to document every occasion when
	you use another's ideas, language, or syntax. You are encouraged to
	study together, discuss readings outside of class, share your drafts
	during peer review and outside of class, and go to the Writing Center
	with your drafts. In this course, those activities are well within the
	bounds of academic honesty. However, when you use another's ideas or
	language, whether through direct quotation, summary, or paraphrase,
	you must formally acknowledge that debt by signaling it with a
	standard form of academic citation.  Even one occasion of academic
	dishonesty, large or small, on any assignment, large or small, will
	result in failure for the entire course and referral to Student
	Judicial Affairs. For University policies on academic honesty please
	see UConn's Responsibilities of Community Life: The Student Code.
	<!--a href="http://www.dosa.uconn.edu/student_code.html"-->
	http://www.dosa.uconn.edu/student_code.html</a>. Please note that
	ignorance of prevailing academic conventions or of UConn's policies
	never excuses a violation. You are encouraged to come see the
        instructor if you have questions about when and how to cite; you
	would also be wise to consult a writing handbook.
        </li>

        <li><b>Students With Disabilities</b>: Students who think that they
	may need accommodations because of a disability are encouraged to
	meet with me privately early in the semester. Students should also
	contact the Center for Students with Disabilities as soon as possible
	to verify their eligibility for reasonable accommodations.  For more
	information, please go to <a href="http://www.csd.uconn.edu/">
	http://www.csd.uconn.edu/</a>.
        </li>

	<li><b>Help with Writing</b>: Students are invited to visit the
	University Writing Center for individualized tutorials. The Writing
	Center staff includes talented and welcoming graduate and
	undergraduate students from across the humanities, social sciences,
	and sciences. They work with writers at any stage of the writing
	process, from exploring ideas to polishing final drafts. Their
	first priority is guiding each student's revisions, so they
	frequently provide a sounding board for a writer's ideas, arguments,
	analytical moves, and uses of evidence. They can also work with you
	on sentence-level concerns, but please note that they will not
	proofread for you; instead, they will help you become a better editor
	of your own work. You should come with a copy of the assignment you
	are working on, a current draft (or notes if you are not yet at the
	draft stage), and ideas about what you want out of a session.
	Tutorials run 45 minutes and are free. You can drop in or make an
	appointment. For hours, locations, and more information, please go
	to <a href="http://writingcenter.uconn.edu">writingcenter.uconn.edu
